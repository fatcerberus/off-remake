    Welcome, Player.
    We have been anticipating your arrival for quite some time.
    ...oh, but we hardly have time for formalities, do we? Let's cut to the chase.
    @show 60f batter
    You have been assigned to a being known as "The Batter". The Batter... well, let's just say he has a very important mission.
    Be sure that it's accomplished.
    @pause 60f
    The switch is now ON, but it won't be for long. We will let you both out in zone 0, where you should solicit the advice of the one known as "The Judge".
    @hide 60f batter
    Good luck.
    Trust us. You're going to need it.
